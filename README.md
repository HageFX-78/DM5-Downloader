## 📝 About

This is a simple userscript that adds a download button for individual manga/manhua chapter as a zip.

## Why is there no batch download?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is preventing the script from loading the images from the main page, bypassing it doesn't work either as returned images are empty as well. So this feature will be unavailable for now.
